		<!-- Website (https://www.glassexp.com/) Review -->
		<center><h2> Business Website - <a href="https://www.glassexp.com/">Glassexp</a> </h2></center>
		<p>A good website must have information in a good layout and everything is well arranged and easily readable, there are some key things that need to see while website building or in web design. In this website many things are good but some are not, although Website has passed some of the Web Design checklist and some good design and animations on various pages like Supplies, Contact along with Footer, <p>Other Pages like News and Gallary can be modified by applying some good web design logics, some images and text re-arrangements, Some Extra Spaces at pages like grinders can be removed, and layout can be modified to good extent, Fevicon can be added. Website content is also good that shows the correct information and reach out information very well.</p> <p> Here are some of the things are good -</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Registerig Domain Name</li>
			<li>Organise Webhosting</li>
			<li>Choose Colors and Fonts for Website</li>
			<li>Logo for Website</li>
			<li>Supplies Arrangment in Different sections</li>
			<li>Images Used</li>
			<li>Footer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>But apart from these there is need of good website design and some other checklist that need to be marked. By observing the website here are some of the things that need to be improved on the basis of good website design.</p>
		<h2 style="color:black">Observations -</h2>
		<h3 style="color:blue">1. Navbar not at Top</h3>
		<p>Navbar is not at the top of the page that make issues with user experience and web design, Navbar should always be the Top of Website of full width.</p>
		<img src='web1.png'/>

		<h3 style="color:blue">2. Logo is too big and not at correct position.</h3>
		<p>Logo must be added in the Navbar, that has small size but visible and placed at the top alongside navbar so that navbar and logo can be arranged correctly give a good loop to the header of the website.</p>
		<img src='web2.png'/>

		<h3 style="color:blue">3. Slideshow is not after the Header.</h3>
		<p>When we talk about Header it should only has Navbar Logo and Search bar only but slideshow should be placed after the Navbar so that website design can become more sophisticated and attractive. Planning a layout should be needed so that web design principals should follow.</p>
		<img src='web4.png'/>

		<h3 style="color:blue">4. Images are not captioned.</h3>
		<p>Images that are added in the page have no caption, no information about what they are and why they are, so caption should be provided to them. Captioning images creates a good impact in web design that shows the proper information of the data that we placed on website.</p>
